HEALTH DISPARITIES </h1>
<h4 style="font-size: 30px;background-color: pastelgreen;color: white;">
 Health disparaties are the contrast or gaps in the level of 
 health and healthcare between gender, race, income, disabilities, geographic location, 
 and sexual orientation. These are associated with social determinants of health such 
 as racism, stigma, poverty, and unequal access to healthcare. However, to specify, 
 we will mainly focus on health disparities among people who cannot access better 
 healthcare due to their geographic location.

   According to Fran (2022), The Philippines always
 has high-quality healthcare. The medical personnel in the Philippines possess
 exceptional qualifications and skills. While state-funded public healthcare in the 
 Philippines is generally of high quality, there are significant differences between 
 rural and urban areas. In the Philippines, GIDA(Geographically Isolated and disadvantaged 
 areas) have been constantly suffering through health disparities due to lack of healthcare 
 facilities in the area. Additionally, most of our health professionals, especially nurses, 
 either work in larger cities or have left the nation for better income, leading to 
 understaffing and delays in treatment in the country.

<h4 style="font-size: 30px;background-color: pastelgreen;color: white;">
             Access to high-quality healthcare services continues to be a challenge for people
			 living in remote communities. Residents in rural areas often have to travel far 
			 to get to hospitals, especially if they need specialized medical help. This can 
			 be hard because it takes a long time, costs a lot of money, transportation may 
			 not be reliable, and means they have to take time off work.
